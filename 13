List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. 
This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not been explained in any previous exercises.

SELECT mdate,team1,
sum(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as score1,team2,
sum(CASE WHEN teamid=team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) as score2
 FROM game left JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
group by mdate,team1,team2 
order by mdate,team1,team2
