The FROM clause says to merge data from the goal table with that from the game table. 
The ON says how to figure out which rows in game go with which rows in goal - the matchid from goal must match id from game. 
(If we wanted to be more clear/specific we could say
ON (game.id=goal.matchid)
The code below shows the player (from the goal) and stadium name (from the game table) for every goal scored.
Modify it to show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every German goal.

SELECT player,teamid,stadium,mdate
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid) where teamid='GER'
